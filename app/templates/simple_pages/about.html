<h1>
    About this Project
</h1>

<p>
    This project is my assesment for the study program "Software Engeneering Foundations" at
    <a class="link" href="https://code.berlin">
    CODE University</a>
    .
</p>
<p>
    My motivation for this Address Changer application came from the struggle you face when you're moving to a new location and you need to change your address for all your accounts (e.g. bank accounts, insurance accounts, internet accounts etc. )
